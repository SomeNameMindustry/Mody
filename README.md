First of all, updates might be inconsistant
Due to the issues listened below, i decided that v0.1 will include more turrets than supposed to add in extra content
Sound effects still don't exist

also since the arrow is transparancy is a little off, and i have no idea how to fix it, we will just remove it

Turrets will be proprely named when i complete this current version (0.1)

v0.1 includes : 

Basically balista and it's relatives and maps where you unlock them

v0.2 will include 

turrets and maps
sentinel tree, if possible

v0.3 will include

--i have no idea--

turrets and maps
that's it
